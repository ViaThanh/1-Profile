### Introduce
Hi! I'm Thanh Vy, though you might also know me as Via or Vivian. I am a final-year student studying Management Information Systems with a major in Data Science. As a data science student, I'm passionate about working with data, particularly in data cleaning and visualization. Beyond data, I enjoy exploring nature, admiring beautiful landscapes and traveling.
These are some notable projects I have completed:
### Project
#### [1.Internship](https://github.com/ViaThanh/1-Profile/blob/058b87ddc67f5ba8d048d5dc754f7ef1cc7d2dfb/B%C3%A1o_C%C3%A1o_Th%E1%BB%B1c_T%E1%BA%ADp_Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Thanh%20Vy.pdf)
TOOLs: SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), Python + Jupyter Notebook, Power BI .
* **SQL:**  was used to analyze competitor data, leveraging Jupyter Notebook to optimize query speed and efficiently connect with Python.
Key analyses performed SQL: Analyzed competitor data using SQL (optimized with Jupyter Notebook) to evaluate financial performance (ROE, ROA, ROS, growth), identify top companies and growth rates, key financial ratios, and accumulated capital by segment. Also ranked companies by performance against industry averages.
* **Python:**  Processed and standardized project data from six offices, including data integration into a single dataset, cleaning (invalid characters, format standardization, error correction), and export to Excel for Power BI and interdepartmental sharing.
* **Power BI:** Developed a visual dashboard for project opportunities based on Python-processed data.
This involved loading and transforming data, creating dimension tables, visualizing aggregated and monthly sales data in a user-friendly interface, and utilizing advanced features like unpivot columns and calculation groups for KPIs.

#### [2.Superstore Sales Data Cleaning and Analysis with SQL](https://github.com/ViaThanh/2-Sales-Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-with-SQL/blob/e2937726a540d61026bda0c486c1743b3e478a44/Store%20Sales%20Analysis%20with%20SQL.ipynb)
TOOLs: SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) . 
This report details the data cleaning and analysis of superstore sales data using SSMS to understand business performance through sales trends, customer behavior, and product line effectiveness.
* **Data Cleaning:** Used stored procedures to handle NULL and empty values, removed duplicates and rows with excessive missing values, standardized text data (ship mode, country, city, region), and imputed missing sales values with appropriate averages.
* **Data Analysis:**
    + Analyzed Average Order Value (AOV) over time and regions, identified top-selling states, tracked monthly/yearly sales growth and purchase frequency.
    + Segmented customers by total sales and AOV, identified top customer segments, and assessed Customer Lifetime and CLTV.
    + Identified top-selling products and category sales contribution.
    + Calculated Customer Churn Rate, identified churned high-value customers, analyzed churn across segments, and investigated potential contributing factors.

#### [3.Netflix Users Behaviours Analysis](https://github.com/ViaThanh/3-Netflix-Users-Behaviours-Analysis/blob/170d32d073eab24e74f3d7fbed8ba9419b924b83/Netflix_Users_Behaviour_Analysis.ipynb)
TOOLs: Python + Jupyter Notebook . 
This report outlines the data analysis process performed on a Netflix Users Behaviours dataset, with the primary goal of gaining actionable insights into user demographics, behavior and revenue generation.
* **Data Analysis:**
    + Demographic Analysis: Analyzed user distribution by age, country, and gender balance across regions and age groups to identify key user segments.
    + User Behavior Analysis: Examined correlations between demographics and subscription types, analyzed device usage patterns across demographics, and reviewed signup trends.
    + Revenue Analysis: Calculated total and average revenue by age group and analyzed revenue distribution by country to identify high-value segments and top-performing regions.
    + Plan Duration Analysis: Investigated the impact of subscription duration on total revenue.


#### [4.Data Preprocessing and Investment Opportunity Analysis + EDA](https://github.com/ViaThanh/4-Data-Preprocessing-and-Investment-Opportunity-Analysis/blob/e2fc02d46ba2ce3b219b48873ac74ad7eb253f7c/EDA_PTTCDN.ipynb)
TOOLs: Python + Jupyter Notebook, Power BI .
The data consists of 03 files: rounds2.csv, mapping.csv and companies.txt.
* **Data Preprocessing and Analysis:**
    + Download and load the data into the program.
    + Carry out data preprocessing: cleaning, filling in missing data, merging datasets and correcting data discrepancies.
    + Analyze the type of investment: compare typical investment amounts in venture, seed, angel, private equity rounds, etc.
    + Analyze by country: identify the countries that have received the most investments in the past.
    + Analyze by sector: analyze the investment distribution across eight main sectors (using mapping.csv to categorize sub-sectors from companies.txt and round2.csv)
* **Conclusion:**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) identified Venture as the most suitable investment type, the United States as the leading country for investment, and 'Others,' 'Cleantech/Semiconductors,' and 'Social, Finance, Analytics and Advertising' as the sectors with the most significant investment activity.
